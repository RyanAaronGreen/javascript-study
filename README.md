# JavaScript Study

This repository exists as a way for me to consolidate, learn, and then teach different concepts of JavaScript. Afterall, if I'm able to explain a concept in writing via blog format, then chances are I'm much closer to actually understanding the concept. The best way to learn something is to find a way to teach it!
